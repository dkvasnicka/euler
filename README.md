Easy, tiger! These are non-mathematician's attempts at solving the Project Euler problems.

Two reasons I'm spending time with Euler:
- A good excercise for my brain
- A good way to learn new programming languages. I actually plan to use as many interesting (to me) languages as possible to solve the problems. Let's see how far I get :)

If you're missing a file for a particular problem, it means I solved it without writing a computer program...
