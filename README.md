My Project Euler solutions
=====

Two reasons I'm (occasionally) spending time with Euler:

- A good excercise for my brain; way to learn new math tricks
- A good way to learn new programming languages

If you're missing a program for some particular problem it means I either solved it without writing one or I simply decided not to solve that problem :)
