A non-mathematician's (probably not very efficient) attempts at solving the Project Euler problems.

Two reasons I'm spending time with Euler:
- A good excercise for my brain
- A good way to learn new programming languages. I actually plan to use as many different languages as possible to solve the problems. Let's see how far I get :)
